# Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a Leaf Detection Model. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect and classify different types of leaves. This project can be useful in various applications such as plant identification, agricultural monitoring, and environmental studies.

This project is a combination of Web-development and Machine Learning.

In this project we have two models:-

*First model is a leaf detection model which detects leaf and tells the plant name. This model is based on Vision Transformers (VIT) technology.

*Second model detects the leaf and tells about the health of the plant. This model is based on CNN technology.



# My Contribution

I did the web-development part of this project including both Frontend and Backend.


# How to use our website?

Our website is very simple to use. We have provided two options in which user can select whether he/she want to upload image from device or want to take live picture from camera. 

After uploading the image user can select from the dropdown whether he/she want to know the plant name or want to check the health of plant.

Then click on the search button and the result will be displayed.

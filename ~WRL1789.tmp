# Dhanvantari-Leaf-Detection-Model

This repository contains the code and resources for a Leaf Detection Model. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect and classify different types of leaves. This project can be useful in various applications such as plant identification, agricultural monitoring, and environmental studies.

This project is a combination of web-development and machine learning.

In this project we have two models:-

*First model is a leaf detection model which detects leaf and tells the plant name. This model is based on Vision Transformers (VIT) technology.

*Second model detects the leaf and tells about the health of the plant. This model is based on CNN technology.
